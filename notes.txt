Notes:

- components do not follow breakdown from wireframes
- choices made of how to break app into componenents is odd
- year component does not make use of input component as discussed extensively during planning
- naming choices are odd or confusing (e.g. VEverything, class and property names)
- functionality for data transfer between components is missing
- components are not self-closing where possible (mostly resolved)
- does not follow style guide
  - components with multiple attributes are left on one line
  - instance options are out of order
  - no helpful spacing used
  - properties are not alphabetized
- unnecessary divs and classes (unused)
- unnecessary specificity (background-color)
- pseudoclasses
- contrary to prior decision, using scoped styles when they should be unscoped everywhere except App
- contrary to prior decision, some component styles are in global scss files
- random singleton application of BEM style (VDropdown)
- the piece we could not resolve on our own, linking to the API, is unfinished
- additional logic (e.g. min and max year) not specified in wireframes
- odd prop specs (type choice, default/req not set, etc.)
- needs rebase (mixing both work and personal accounts)

* It seems like I was right re: feeling slots for this PoC were a bad idea. The field and dropdown component are essentially the same with the same error handling logic and appearance. However with the slot it appears to be impossible to delegate error handling to the slot container as it has no way of knowing when the slot child input has been changed.

TODO:
- clean up CSS
- update weird flex specs in wireframes
- Remove developer from wireframes
- move labels, etc. to props
- add functionality
- bring in fuzzy search capability
- either add clear button to wireframes (more work for everyone else) or remove it from app
