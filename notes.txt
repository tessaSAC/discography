Notes:

- components do not follow breakdown from wireframes
- choices made of how to break app into componenents is odd
- year component does not make use of input component as discussed extensively during planning
- naming choices are odd or confusing (e.g. VEverything, class and property names)
- functionality for data transfer between components is missing
- components are not self-closing where possible (mostly resolved)
- does not follow style guide
  - components with multiple attributes are left on one line
  - instance options are out of order
  - no helpful spacing used
  - properties are not alphabetized
- unnecessary divs and classes (unused)
- unnecessary specificity (background-color)
- pseudoclasses
- contrary to prior discussion, using scoped styles when they should be unscoped everywhere except App
- random singleton application of BEM style (VDropdown)
- the piece we could not resolve on our own, linking to the API, is unfinished
- additional logic (e.g. min and max year) not specified in wireframes
- odd prop specs (type choice, default/req not set, etc.)

TODO:
- clean up CSS
- move labels, etc. to props
- add functionality
- bring in fuzzy search capability
